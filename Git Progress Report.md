Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I created the code for it to take a month day and year then have it return the date along with the day of the week.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Creating the ability for the code to create a file with special notes attached with the date listed on them

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?


Handling files in c is proving to be a challenge compared to python it is drastically more complicated. Also since
my teacher wants us to do this with only specific function it is proving to be annoting to look for a solution just to find
a function you are not allowed to use. The last problem I have been having is frustration. When I did the original project I was excited but since the main idea of my project literally broke leaving me to have to use a backup plan, it has become hard to feel enthusiastic. This feels like a project I'm just doing to get a good grade rather than genuine intrest.
